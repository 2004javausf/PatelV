Polymorphism Overloading : Order of Operations
	1. exact match of type and number of arguments
	2. conversion - primitives/objects that cast themselves into other types (pri to pri && Obj to Obj)
	3. boxing/unboxing - going from a primitive to object or vice versa
	4. Varargs - arguments wrapped into arrays.
